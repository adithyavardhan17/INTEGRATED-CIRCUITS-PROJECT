This project presents the design and implementation of a touch sensor buzzer 
generator using the IC555 timer. The primary objective is to develop a touchsensitive circuit that can trigger a buzzer, making it an ideal solution for 
applications requiring a simple, cost-effective, and efficient touch-based alert 
system.
